===== Introduction  =====
The general idea of this task is to analyse the module objectives by separating known and unknown technical terms and rephrasing the module objectives in our own words. In this way, we should find out which competences we should have at the end.

===== Assignments =====
  - Read all modul goals carefully.
  - Underscore familiar and unfamiliar technical terms.
  - Rephrase with your partner the modul goals.
  - Prepare to present your solution to the class.

===== Solution =====
The result is discussed in plenary. Updating the solution is in the responsibility of the student. 

===== Vocabulary =====
| objective | Ziel / Zielvorstellung|
| technical terms | Fachbegriffe |
| means of aid | Hilfsmittel |
