==== Database System (DBS) ====
A Database System (DBS) encompasses the database, the DBMS, and associated hardware and software components. It represents the complete environment for managing data.

**Components of a DBS**
  * Database (DB): The stored data itself.
  * Database Management System (DBMS): The software for managing the DB.


==== Database (DB) ====
A database (DB) is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval and management. It stores information in a systematic way, allowing users to access, modify, and analyze data as needed. Basically, it is several Excel spreadsheets that are linked together.

**Characteristics of a DB **
  * Organized: Data is arranged in a logical manner (tables, records, fields).
  * Integrated: Data is related and consistent across the database.
  * Shared: Multiple users can access and update data simultaneously.
  * Controlled: Access to data is managed through security measures.


==== Database Management System (DBMS) ====
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with users and applications to create, store, modify, and retrieve data from a database. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the database.

**Functions of a DBMS**
  * Data Definition: Creates and modifies the database structure.
  * Data Manipulation: Allows users to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.
  * Data Query: Enables users to search and retrieve specific data.
  * Data Integrity: Ensures data accuracy and consistency.
  * Data Security: Protects data from unauthorized access.
