==== Breakdown of CRUD Operations ====
  * **Create**: This involves adding new data to the system. For example, creating a new user account, adding a product to an inventory, or posting a new blog article.
  * **Read**: This operation is about retrieving data from the system. It could be fetching a list of users, displaying product details, or loading a blog post.
  * **Update**: This involves modifying existing data. Changing a user's password, updating product pricing, or editing a blog post are common update operations.
  * **Delete**: This is the process of removing data from the system. Deleting a user account, removing a product from the inventory, or deleting a blog post are examples.
