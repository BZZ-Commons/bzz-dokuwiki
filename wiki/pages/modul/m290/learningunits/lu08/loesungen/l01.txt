===== Assignments =====
As always, our first program on the server is a small script designed to greet the world with the infamous “Hello World”. 

  - Open your Webstorm editor and establish a JavaScriptfile. Name ist //helloWorld.js//. The file extension is assigned automatically.
  - Write in this script your helloWorld statement, using the JS command //console.log()//. Save your file.
  - Generate more terminal outputs by using arrays, for iterations and console.log() function. e.g. //['Hello ', 'World!', 'Hello', 'Universe!'];//
  - Open a terminal window by clicking the terminal-icon at the left lower rim of Webstorm.
  - Install all missing JS packages, that Webstorm requires from you.
  - Start your server by using the node command, e.g. //node myServer.js//
  - If everything is correct, you will see the helloWorld statement as a output from your server in the bottom terminal window of Webstorm.
