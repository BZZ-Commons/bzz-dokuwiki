====== LU10b - Server-Programing with JavaScript ======

===== Learning Objectives =====
  - Programing our first Node Server application "hello world"
  - Know how to start the server application
  - Generate a terminal message

===== HelloWorld.js =====
At the beginning of each programer's carreer there is always our notorious "Hello World". Why changing good habits? Let us also greet the world with a first server script.

  - For that we need to create in our Webstorm a new JavaScript file with the title "helloWorld". Please note, that the file ending will be set as "js", if you choose the right file type.
  - Furthermore we generate a console output with the js command: //console.log//. The entire line looks then like: console.log('Hello World!');

In the lower part of Webstorm you can open a terminal window to start the mini-server-application. A node server is always started with the commande **node + servername.js**. In our case it is **node helloworld.js**, which generates the console output, just as we intended.
