====== LU03.S07 - ERD: Reingineering of a existing database  ======

===== Task  =====
Go to the W3Schools-Website, to the SQL-Editor, and analyze the existing data-structure. Create furthermore an ERD, that describes the existing data-structure in the Crow's Foot Notation.

===== Suggested approach=====
  - We beginn the diagramm by identifying the entities. these are tables without any foreign keys: 
      * Customers
      * Categories
      * Employees
      * Shippers 
      * Suppliers
  - Then we determine the attributes and the data-types of each entity (-table).
  - We continue with the analysis of the relations. These are tables, which have foreign keys in their attribute list.
     * Orders
     * OrderDetails
     * Products  
  - Finally, we connect the tables with each other in the right fashion and determine the cardinalities (1:1, 1:n, n:m)
