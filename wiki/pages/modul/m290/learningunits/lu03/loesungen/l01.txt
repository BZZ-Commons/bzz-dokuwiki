====== LU03.L01 - Choose data-types ======

Which datatype would you use to store the following information? Give reason for your decision.

1. Product-title like trousers up to 50 characters:
  *<color #ed1c24>VARCHAR(50)</color>
  *<color #ed1c24>Titles can be at the most 50 characters. A fix length makes no sense in that case. </color>

2. Product-description up to 255 characters:
  *<color #ed1c24>VARCHAR(255)</color>
  *<color #ed1c24>The description can be 255 characters, but can also be shorter. A fix length does not make sense in that case. </color>

3. Stock amount:
  *<color #ed1c24>INT or INTEGER</color>
  *<color #ed1c24>Floating point type is not suitable as pieces are always counted in whole numbers.  </color>

4. Price of each piece: 
  *<color #ed1c24>FLOAT(5,2) or DECIMAL(U5,2)</color>
  *<color #ed1c24>Prices have floating point</color>
  * <color #ed1c24>The length of (5,2) should be sufficient enough as trousers are usually within a price ranger of 0.99 to 999.99. </color>

5. Order date: 
  *<color #ed1c24>DATE or DATETIME</color>
  *<color #ed1c24>The type depends on whether we want to safe only the date, but also the time. </color>
  *<color #ed1c24>Usually in such cases to store only the order-date is enough.</color> 

6. Date of delivery:
  *<color #ed1c24>DATETIME or TIMESTAMP</color>
  *<color #ed1c24>Regarding delivery quality the criteria punctuality might be one key element. Therefore the storage of the delivery-time is compulsory.</color>
 
7. organic or not: 
  *<color #ed1c24>BOOLEAN</color> 
  *<color #ed1c24>As there a only two possibilites to store a boolean data-type is the correct data-type. </color>

8. Usage category with only one character:
  * <color #ed1c24>CHAR</color> 
  * <color #ed1c24>As long as there is only one character to be stored the CHAR-type will work. </color>
  * <color #ed1c24>Technically the CHAR-types allows all letters, digits (as letters) and special characters.</color>
