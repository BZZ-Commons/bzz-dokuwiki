  * Timeframe: 10 Minutes
  * Expected result: A Word/PDF file with an ERD that visualises the given business case.

==== Task ====
Your assignment is to analze the given ERD (coneptual datamodel), which is in fact the last step before creating the actual db ins our Mysql database system, and draw the ERD as a logial data model. The subtasks are:

  - develop the logical datamodel (tables, attributes, data types, fk/pk) by using the Crow's Foot Notation
  - realize the realation as ralation tables (id, fk_tab1, fk_tab2, ...)
  - finalize the ERM by adding the cardinalities (1:1, 1:many, ...)
