====== LU03b - Data-types ======
In chapter LU03b we want to talk about data-types, why we are in need of them, and how they are used in the database world in order to specify the content of tables. 

==== Most common MySQL data-types ====
MySQL provides us with a variety of data types to fulfil the most diverse data requirements. Let's take a look at the most important categories:

  * **Numeric Data Types**: Used for storing numerical values.
    * INT or INTEGER: Standard integers (-2147483648 to 2147483647), example: storing a person's age.
    * FLOAT: Approximate numeric values with single precision, example: storing product prices.
    * DECIMAL(M,D): Exact numeric values with fixed decimal points (M total digits, D decimal places), example: amount DECIMAL(10,2) for storing monetary amounts.
  * **String Data Types**: Used for storing textual data: 
    * CHAR(M): Fixed-length character string (M characters), example: gender CHAR(1) for storing 'M' or 'F'.
    * VARCHAR(M): Variable-length character string (up to M characters), text data up to 65535 characters
  * **Binary Data Types**:
    * BOOLEAN: Boolean value (TRUE, FALSE)
  * **Date and Time Data Types**: Used for storing date and time values.
    * DATE: Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    * TIME: Time (HH:MM:SS)
    * DATETIME: Date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
    * TIMESTAMP: Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) with time zone
    * Example: birth_date DATE for storing a person's birth date.

**Please note that ...**
  * the data-types offered depend on the database System, which is currently in use. 
  * we are going to use the DBS MySQL, therefore we use MySQL data-types.
  * the list of data-types below is an extract with the most common ones and therefore not complete. 
  * The following figure shows all possible data-types
