====== LU04b - Reading from one table ======
The simplest SELECT is reading from a table, as we don't have to deal with the connection between other tables. Let's have a quick look on the different parts of an average SELECT statement. Therefore, we will use our Customer Table as practical example for demonstration purposes.

===== SELECT ====
We can use the **SELECT** in different ways, e.g
  * **SELECT * **
    * * (asterix) stands here for all columns in the table
    * the entire content of the table, columns as created, sorted by the primary key in ascending order.
  * **SELECT myColumn1, myColumn3, myColumn5**
    * By specifying the columns we want to retrieve, we can reduce the output according to our needs.
    * The target columns are to seperated by commas
  * **SELECT myColumn3, myColumn5, myColumn1** 
    * We can also change the order in which the columns are to be displayed
