===== Introduction  =====
The overarching topic of Module 290 is data and how to deal with it. It therefore makes sense to start with the installation of a database. There are a variety of databases on the market. Our product of choice is the MySQL database, as the licence is free for educational purposes.

===== Assignments =====
  - Go to the MySQL website and download the required software version. 
  - Start the installation process.
  - Once the installation is complete, start the post-installation steps.   
  - Open the command line/terminal on your notebook and connect to the database as shown in the video tutorials.
  - Finally, request a response from the database by entering "SELECT sysdate;". If you have carried out all the steps correctly, the database will respond with the current date and time of your PC.
  - Thank God that you have succeeded. Otherwise, pray to God for inspiration AND a lot of patience to find the error.
