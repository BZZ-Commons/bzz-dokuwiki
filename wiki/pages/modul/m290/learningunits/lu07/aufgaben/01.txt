===== Requirements  =====
  * Work type: Individual
  * Timeframe: 10 Minutes
  * Means of aid: 
      * Only teaching materials, no websearch, no use of ai.
  * Expected result: 
    * Conduct the database schema (instance) as foundation for our employee's data.

===== Assignments =====

==== A: DATA SCHEMA ====
First of all we need a database schema (database workspace). Execute the following two lines on your MySQL installation.

  CREATE DATABASE hr_database;
  SHOW DATABASES;
  USE hr_database;

==== B: CREATE TABLE ====
To exercise the DML commands, we need a suitable table including a reasonable amout of data. The following SQL statement will create a table **employee** regarding all necessary attributes of an "average employee".

  CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (
    employee_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,       -- Employee ID as the primary key
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,         -- Name of the employee (max length 50 characters)
    surname VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,      -- Surname of the employee (max length 50 characters)
    birthdate DATE NOT NULL,           -- Birthdate of the employee
    sex CHAR(1),                       -- Sex of the employee (M/F/O for other)
    pronomen VARCHAR(10),              -- Pronoun of the employee
    employment_date DATE NOT NULL,     -- Date when the employee was hired
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,    -- Salary of the employee (up to 10 digits, 2 decimal places)
    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL    -- Department where the employee works
  );

**Explanation**
  - **employee_ID** is the primary key and ensures that each employee has a unique ID.
  - **name** and **surname** are 'VARCHAR' fields that store the name and surname of the employee.
  - **birthdate** and **employment_date** use the 'DATE' data type to store the birth and employment dates.
  - **sex** is stored as a 'CHAR(1)' type to represent gender with one letter ('M' for male, 'F' for female, etc.).
  - **pronomen** stores the employee's pronouns.
  - **salary** is stored as a 'DECIMAL' value to account for financial precision.
  - **department** is a VARCHAR(50) field that stores the name of the department the employee is associated with. It has a NOT NULL constraint to ensure that every employee is assigned to a department.
