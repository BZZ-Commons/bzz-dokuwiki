====== LU07.S01 - Preparatory work======

===== A: Creating the data schema =====
First of all we need a database schema (database workspace). Execute the following two lines on your MySQL installation.

  CREATE DATABASE hr_database;
  SHOW DATABASES;
  USE hr_database;
  
After executing the three SQL commands above, the feedback from your database would look like in the image below:

**Result in webstorm**

Please note, that the table is actually empty, that means that a "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees" leads to "0" results.

==== B: CREATE TABLE =====
To exercise the DML commands, we need a suitable table including a reasonable amout of data. The following SQL statement will create a table **employee** regarding all necessary attributes of an "average employee".

  CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (
    employee_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,       -- Employee ID as the primary key
    ....

**Result in Webstorm**

After creating the table "employees" the result in our Webstorm ought to look like the figure above:
