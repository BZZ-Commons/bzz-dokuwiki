The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. It can be executed with or without a WHERE clause, depending on whether you want to update specific rows or all rows.

===== UPDATE with Filter (WHERE Clause) =====
Using a WHERE clause allows you to target specific rows to update. This ensures that only rows meeting a certain condition are modified.

**Syntax**
  UPDATE table_name 
  SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 
  WHERE condition;

**Example**
  UPDATE employees 
  SET salary = 60000 
  WHERE employee_id = 1;

===== UPDATE without Filter =====
If you omit the WHERE clause, the UPDATE command will modify every row in the table, which can lead to unintended changes, so it must be used with caution.

**Syntax**
  UPDATE table_name 
  SET column1 = value1;
  
**Example**
  UPDATE employees 
  SET salary = 70000;
