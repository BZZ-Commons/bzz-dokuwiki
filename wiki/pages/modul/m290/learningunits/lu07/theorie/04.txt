===== 3. DELETE Statement =====
The DELETE command is used to remove records from a table. Like UPDATE, it can be run with or without a filter, making it vital to define the condition to avoid unintended data removal.

===== DELETE with Filter (WHERE Clause) =====
Using a WHERE clause ensures that only specific rows matching the condition will be deleted.

**Syntax:**
  DELETE FROM table_name 
  WHERE condition;

**Example**
  DELETE FROM employees 
  WHERE employee_id = 1;
  
  
===== DELETE without Filter =====
Omitting the WHERE clause removes all data from the table, so it must be used cautiously. This operation doesnâ€™t remove the table structure, just the rows.

**Syntax:**
  DELETE FROM table_name;

**Example:**
  DELETE FROM employees;
