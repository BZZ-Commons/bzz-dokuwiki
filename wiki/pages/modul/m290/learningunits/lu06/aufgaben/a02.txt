====== LU09.A02 - SQL- DCL: CREATE USER ======
It is high time to mess a litte around with our new SQL powers, don't you think? So, let's try it directly on our Webstorm. 

As the database administrator, we want to create a new user and only grant this user the necessary rights to operate the web application, which includes DML operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, but not DDL operations such as CREATE or DROP of tables. After all, we don't want the webapplication take control over our database, are we?

===== Requirements  =====
  * Work type: individual
  * Timeframe: 20 Minutes
  * Means of aid: 
      * only teaching materials, no websearch, no use of ai.
      * Webstorm with connection to the MySQL-DB
  * Expected result: Semantically and syntactically correct SQL statements according to the requirements of the case studies. 

===== Case studies / Assignments =====
As a database administrators we are assigned to create a AppUser, which has for security reasons only the right for DML operations, but must not be allowed for DDL operation. We don't want a hacker to delete our entire webshop, do we? 

To get the job done, follow the instructions below:

  - Create as the sysdba (systemadministrator of the databaswe) a new user
  - Grant this role only the necessary rights
  - Create as a sysdba a test table and fill it with some testdata
  - Establish a new connection within the webstorm by using the credentials of this new user
  - Try out the DML operations, wich should be possible (insert, update, delete)
  - Try out to DDL operations, which should result in errors due to missing permissions for that particular user
  - Drop the newly created user finally

==== Task 2.1 ====
**Create the User**: Create a user named //restrictedUser// with the password //SafePassword123// using the //mysql_native_password// plugin.

  CREATE USER 'restrictedUser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'SafePassword123';

==== Task 2.2 ====
** Overview of the current privileges**: Display all users.

  SELECT user, host, plugin FROM mysql.user;

The result set should look like:

==== Task 2.3 ====
**Grant Privileges Without Table Management**: Grant the user //restrictedUser// the ability to read and write data but not to create, alter, or drop tables. Use the following commands to give only the required privileges.

  GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON myDatabase.* TO 'restrictedUser'@'localhost';

==== Task 2.4 ====
**Rovoke Privileges**: To be certain that nothing unintended can happen revoke the CREATE, ALTER, and DROP privileges explicitly.

  REVOKE CREATE, ALTER, DROP ON myDatabase.* FROM 'restrictedUser'@'localhost';

==== Tasc 2.5 ====
**View the User’s Privileges**: Check the privileges to ensure that the user cannot manage tables.

  SHOW GRANTS FOR 'restrictedUser'@'localhost';
  
==== Task 2.6 ====
**Test the User’s Access**: Establish a new console connection to the database by using //restrictedUser + password//.

==== Task 2.7 ====

Finally, try to perform a CREATE TABLE or DROP TABLE operation. The attempt should result in a permission error als displayed in the image below.

==== Task 2.8 ====
**Delete the User (optional)**: After testing, you can delete the user if they are no longer needed.
