====== LU04e - Adding and testing an API ======
<sup>Internal reference: learningunits/04-5.md</sup>
\\
===== Goals =====
  -I can migrate/prepare an app for testing over the network (primarily http)
  -I can set up and run the app in container.
  -I can run prepared tests (primarily unit test) against the containerized app.
  -If there are any errors, I can analyze the error, suggest and test an initial workaround (troubleshooting).

\\
===== Basics =====
Life Demo Project Traffic light with the following steps:
  -Start the containerized app
  -Test welcome message with curl
  -Run unit tests against the API

\\
===== Exercises =====
  -Setup Jenkins ''03/02_Exercises/01-Exercise.md to 03-Exercise.md'' - according to the learning objectives (see course repository).
  -If there is an error, read the message carefully, think about a solution and implement it.
