<sup>Internal reference: learningunits/04-3.md</sup>
\\
===== Goals =====
  -I can configure Jenkins with required **plugins**.
  -I can set up, configure and test a **CI/CD pipeline** in Jenkins for a sample app.
  -I can retrieve and apply a CI/CD Pipeline in Jenkins as a **Pipeline-Code-File**.
  -If there are any errors, I can analyze the error, suggest and test an initial workaround (troubleshooting).
