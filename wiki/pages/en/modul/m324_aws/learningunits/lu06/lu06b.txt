====== LU06b - Checkout pipeline with private repository ======
<sup>Internal reference: learningunits/06-2.md</sup>
\\
===== Goals =====
  -I can set up a private repo (i.e. on GitHub).
  -I can set up a Jenkins pipeline stage for checkout code from a private repo.
  -If there are any errors, I can analyze the error, suggest and test an initial workaround (troubleshooting).

\\
===== Exercises =====
  -Setup Jenkins ''06/02_Exercises/01'' - according to the learning objectives (see course repository).
  -If there is an error, read the message carefully, think about a solution and implement it.
