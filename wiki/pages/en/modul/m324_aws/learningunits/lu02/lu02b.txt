<sup>Internal reference: learningunits/02-2.md</sup>

===== Goals =====
  -I can explain the roles and responsibilities of the Jenkins **master (controller)** and **agents**.
  -I can explain how **build tasks are delegated**, and how communication between master and agents occurs.
  -I can distinguish between **vertical scaling** and **horizontal scaling**.
  -I can identify the benefits and trade-offs of each scaling approach for performance, maintenance, and reliability.
  -I recognize the **importance of test and production environments**.
  -I understand why Jenkins setups should include separate test and production instances to ensure stability and safe testing of upgrades, plugins, and pipelines.
