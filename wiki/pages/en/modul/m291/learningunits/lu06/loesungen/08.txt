====== LU06.S08 - Events - basic calculator ======

===== Assignment =====
This assignment compraises the programming of a tiny caculator for basic calculation operations, meaning two diggit have to be added together. To do the assignment we need two blocks of diggits-buttons and a operation-button "+" to execute the operation respectively to receive the result.

==== Assignment A - 3' =====
  * A01: Create in Webstorm in your directory **06_methods** a html file and name it correctly **LU06.S08**.
  * A02: Copy the structure of the sfc (single file component) from a solution of your choice (in that way we don't have to type it manually --> easier and faster)
  * A03: Make sure to have 
    * the assignment number <h1>-titel and 
    * the description in <h3>-format
  * A04: Safe it.

==== Assignment B - Variables - 5' ====
  * B01: To make an addition work in our VUE instance we need threee variables with the corresponding initial values
    * diggit1:0
    * diggit2:0
    * result:0  

==== Assignment C - Button for diggit 1 - 10' ====
  * C01: Create the buttons 1 to 4 (that shall suffice for our purpose)  
  * C02: When clicking on one of them the content will be saved in the variable **diggit1** with the corresponding number 1-4, meaning when clicking the 1, the variable diggit will be set with 1.

==== Assignment D - Button for diggit 2 - 2' ====
  * D01: Create the second set of buttons 1 to 4 to set the second diggit. (4 of them shall suffice for our purpose)  
  * D02: When clicking on one of them the content will be saved in the variable **diggit2**

==== Assignment E: Implementation of the calculation - 10'  ====
  * E01: To execute our addition-operation we finally need a button **Operator**-button.
  * E02: Clicking this operator-Button adds diggit1 to diggit2 and displays the result (result = diggit1 + diggit2)

==== Assignment F: Reset button - 5'  ====
  * F01: Create finally a **reset**-button which sets all value to the initial ones.
  * F02: Meaning clicking on the reset-button uses: result=0, diggit1=0, diggit2=0
