===== Assignments  ======
The idea of this assignment is to exercise on the one hand the four basic events, and on the other hand the increment and decrement-operators with various step-sizes. As a base for our exercise we are goint to change the appearance of html-visual-elements such as background colour. Your result should look as following

==== Assignment A ====
  - Test the code example provided to you: When moving the mouse over a list food elements each element must change the backgroundcolour to grey.
  - Make sure that you have the title <h1>  and have the correctl filename: **lu06.s07.html**  
  - After moving the mouse over the colour area the background-colour should change randomly. Behind this effect there is a sophisticated Math-Operation.
  - Replace the math-method with a **simple increment** operation with **step-size 1**. 
  - Start with the **colour value of 0**.

==== Assignment B ====
  - Add another area for the a **right-click** event.
  - Start with a **colour value of 120**
  - Decrement **step-size is 2**

==== Assignment C ====
  - Add another area for the a **left-click** event.
  - Start with a **colour value of 240**
  - Increment **step-size is 5**

==== Assignment C ====
  - Add another area for the a **left-click** event.
  - Start with a **colour value of 240**
  - Increment **step-size is 5**

==== Assignment D ====
  - Add another area for the a **mouseover** event.
  - Start with a **colour value of 360**
  - Decrement **step-size is 10**
      
==== Assignment E ====
  - Add to all four textareas a mouse-middle event which resets all colour to the initial values.
  - **Hint**: To get the initial values, you need to store te values in separately in the first place: either in 4 variables or in a array with all four initial values.
