====== LU07.S02 - Methods with arguments ======

===== Prerequisites  =====
  * Work type: Individual
  * Means of aid: only teaching materials, no websearch, no use of ai.
  * Timeframe: 15 Minutes
  * Expected result: A Vue-Script, which uses methods to display messages on the screen and increments and decrements a counter. 

===== Learning Objectves =====
  - Implementing VUE methods by using arguments. 
  - Increment and decrement a counter within a method.
  - Writing own methods and making use of them.

===== Assignment A - 2' ======
  * A01: Test the code example above which was provided to you. Describe the behaviour of the script using HTML comments.
  * A02: Make sure that everthing is working correctly: The moose-count uses the method **addMoose** by processing the number we need to count up or down
    - increments by 1
    - decrements by -1
    - increments by +5
  A03: Make sure that you have the title <h1> and have correctly named the file: **lu07.s02.html**

===== Assignment B - 5' =====
  * B01: Currently we can increment by +1 and +5, and decrement by -1.
  * B02: Similar to **addMoose** add method **removeMoose** which manges the decrement operations and use it. 
  * B03: Test your results and save it.
  * B04: Add more buttons wich can 
      - increment by +10
      - decrement by -10
      - decrement by -5
  * B05: The aim is to have 3 increment-buttons (+1, +5, +10) and 3 decrement-buttons (-1, -5, -10)

===== Assignment C: Catching numbers belov zero (0) - 8' =====
  * C01: At 0 we must stop counting, when the count reches the zero. 
  * C02: Add the case below zero to your **removeMoose-method** by checking the **count** with a if-statement
  * C03: Check the result: It must stop at zero when the button **removeMoose** when the count reaches 0.
  * C04: In the case below zero the user must be informed accordingly.
