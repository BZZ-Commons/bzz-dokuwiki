===== Assignment 1 ======
As we are now capable to use //v-if// with logical values (true/false), and furthermore check actual values e.g. numbers, this assignment is about hoch to check //string-values// (words). For this we are going to use the function //text.includes()// within the //v-if//.

  - Execute the script. As you can see the content of the variable text is displayed on the screen as //text// contains the search-string //Pizza// with a kapital //P//.
  - Now delete the word //Pizza// from the variable //text// in the script-area. Execute your script again. 
  - Note your realisations as a comment.
  - Save your script acordingly, whether in your W3School workspace or locally in your Webstorm code-editor

===== Assignment 2 =====
In the if paragraph there is a image of a pizza displayed as well. 

  - Add a section //v-else// with a according //img-tag// which shows a different image than a pizza.
  - Note your realisations as a code-comment.
  - Save your script acordingly, whether in your W3School workspace or locally in your Webstorm code-editor
