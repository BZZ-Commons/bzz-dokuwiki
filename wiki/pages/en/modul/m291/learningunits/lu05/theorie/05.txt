===== Introduction ====
The **v-for** directive in Vue.js is a powerful tool for rendering (the process of converting data, code or digital instructions into a visual representation on the screen) lists of elements in HTML templates. It allows developers to iterate through a data source and create a template element for each element in the data source (e.g. array). In addition to basic lists, **v-for** can also be used to iterate (loop through) a series of numbers, object properties or even nested structures. By combining it with other directives such as **v-bind** and **v-on**, **v-for** extends the possibilities of interactive data binding in Vue applications.


  <template>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="(item, index) in items" :key="index">
        {{ index + 1 }}. {{ item }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </template>

  <script>
  export default {
    data() {
      return {
        items: ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
      };
    }
  };
  </script>

**Explanation**
  * The v-for="(item, index) in items" directive loops through the items array.
  * :key="index" helps Vue track each element efficiently.
  * The output will be a list displaying "Apple," "Banana," and "Cherry" in order.
