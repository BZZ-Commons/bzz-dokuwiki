====== LU05a - VUE Directives ======

===== Learning ojectives =====
  - I can explain what //Vue Directives// are. 
  - I can explain what //Vue Directives// are used for.
  - I can name and explain at least four types of directives.
  - I can use VUE directives as an example.

===== Introduction =====
Vue directives are special tokens in //Vue.js// that extend the functionality of HTML by providing dynamic behavior to DOM elements. They are prefixed with //v-// and are used to bind data, manipulate DOM attributes, or listen to events. Common directives include //v-bind// for binding attributes, //v-if// for conditional rendering, and //v-for// for looping over data. By leveraging directives, developers can create highly interactive and reactive user interfaces with minimal effort.

===== Key Features =====
** 1. Reactivity:** Automatically update the DOM when the underlying data changes.

** 2. Extensibility:** You can create custom directives for advanced behavior.

** 3. Simplicity: **Integrate seamlessly into templates for common tasks like event handling or conditional rendering.

===== Examples =====
  - **v-if**: Conditionally renders an element or removes it from the DOM based on the truthiness of an expression.
  - **v-for**: Iterates over a list or object, generating a new element for each item in the collection.
  - **v-bind**: Dynamically binds an attribute (e.g., `src`, `class`, `style`) to an expression, allowing for reactive updates.
  - **v-model**: Creates a two-way binding between a form input or component and a Vue instance's data property.
