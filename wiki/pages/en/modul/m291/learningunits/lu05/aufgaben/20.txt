====== LU05.A20 - Knowledge Transer to Webstorm  ======

===== Pre-requisites  =====
  * Work type: Individual
  * Means of aid: only teaching materials, no websearch, no use of ai.
  * Timeframe: 70 Minutes
  * Expected result: TheVUE-Script 2 to 18 are transfered to Webstorm in the required directory structure. 

===== Learning objectives =====
  * Know how to write and execute a VUE SFC in Webstorm

===== Source =====
You can take your solutions from assigmnent 2 to 18. Elsewise download the official solutions from the solution page of the assignment, but add the insight to the code as source code comments.

===== Assignment  ======
Programming within an emulator e.g. **W3School | VUE** is nice, but not really programming. Thus, we need to transfer our script to the Webstorm code-ditor. **Please note, that this assignment is noot only a mere task, but also a preparatory work for the LB2.**

  - Create a directory **media** and safe the requiered images in it.
  - Transfer your solutions from the assignments 2 to 18 to the Webstorm code-editor
  - Remember a simple best-practise: Test every script before proceeding with the next one.
  - Use the following directory structure 
      - **01_v-bind**: assignment 2 - 6
      - **02_v-if**: assignment 7 - 11
      - **03_v-show**: assignment 12 - 14
      - **04_v-for**: assignment 15 - 17
      - **05_combined**: assignment 18
  - Make sure, that each solution is properly named after the assignment (e.g. **lu05.s10.html**) and the name of the assignment is displayed as <h1>
  - Delete all unnecessary code-parts.
  - **Test the correctness** of the transfer by executing the script (Browser Button on the right upper corner of the window).
  - if not already done, **add comments** as HTML or JS notation to note down important insights to your code
