===== Assignment  ======
After successfully being able to manage 2-dimensional-arrays with the v-for directive, it is time to take next challenge: the combined usage of v-for and v-if. 

Though the assignment is to display the pictures only, when they are liked. For that we need to check the status, it they are **OK** we display the image of the dish, if they are **NOK** we simply give out the name and the status of the dish, but no image of it. 

  - Take your result from the previous assignment and safe it **lu05.s17.html**
  - Add a <div>-tag just before the <img> for the **v-if**. Make shure that the image-tag is within the if-statement.
    - The output is in that case of **OK**: <color #ed1c24>I like ... </color>
    - close the div
  - Execute your script. If everything was done properly you will receive a message what you like, in red letters AND the image of the dish.
  - Add a second <div> for the **v-else**
    - The output is in that case of **OK**: <color #22b14c>I don't like  </color>
    - In that case there is no image to display!!!
    - close the div
  - Execute your script. If everything was done properly you will receive a message what you don't like, in green letters, but without the image of it.
