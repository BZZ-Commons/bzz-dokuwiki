  - Change within the **v-for** the **x** to **z**. 
  - Execute your script  --> The images will will disappear. Why?
  - Then change **x** within the //<figcaption>// and the //<img>// from **x** to a **z** as well --> The images will appear again. Why?
  - Note down for what the first respectively the second usage of **x/z** stands for. 

===== Assignment 2 =====
It can happen, that besides the image, we also want to display the description of our products on our website. Thus we want to handle a //multi-dimensional array//. 

  - Add a column **comm**-column with comments to your food-list (array) in the script part. 
    * If you like it: **OK**. 
    * If not: **NOK**
  - Display the comm-entries after the name of the dish by using **z.comm**
  - Execute your script. If everything was done properly you will see the images as before AND the comment below the images.
  - Comment your script accordingly an save it.
