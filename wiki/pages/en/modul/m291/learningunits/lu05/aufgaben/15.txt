===== Assignment ======
Data is often available as lists/arrays (concatenation of persons, for example). Previously, we prepared these lists in JavaScript using a loop and passed them to HTML for display. With v-for, we can now use the loop directly in JS, which makes things a lot easier.

  - Click on the provided link above and it with the appropriate name in your W3School workspace.
  - Execute it with **Run**. You will see that the array data in the script part is now displayed numbered in the browser.   
  - Add 3-4 more entries to your food list, at the beginning, the middle part, and the end.
  - Change the <ol>-tag to  <ul>-tag.
  - Note down your observation as code comments and save your work.
