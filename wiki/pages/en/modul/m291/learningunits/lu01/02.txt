===== Example for calculating the modul grade =====
In the first exam Leo/Lea achieved 4.5, but in the exam 2 Lea/Leo was more focused and therefore got a 5.5. The modul grade is in that case calculated as follows:

  Modul grade of Leo/Lea = 0.4 * Exam1 + 0.6 * Exam2 
  = 0.4*4.5 + 0.6*5.8
  = 1.8 + 3.48 = 5.28

The calcualted 5.28 is mathematically rounded up to a 5.5. Congratulations to Lea/Leo, the effort in the 2nd part of the module was worth it for Leo/Lea, wasn't it. She really smashed it!!!
