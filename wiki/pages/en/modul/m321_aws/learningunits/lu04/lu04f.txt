====== LU04f - Service Resiliency ======
===== Goals =====
  -I'm able to count and explain the relevant pieces of the "self-healing" mechanism of K8s.
  -I'm able to explain the purpose of each piece in my own words.
  -I'm able to illustrate and verify this mechanism in an example.
  -I can suggest and implement at least one measure when an error message appears.

===== Basics =====
In [[en:modul:m321_aws:topics:09|this article]] you will learn how K8s "self-heals".

===== Study case =====
  -Work on ''09/02_Exercises/01/Exercise.md to /02/Exercise.md'' located in your repository.
  -If an error occurs, read the message carefully, think of a solution and implement it.
