====== LU04e - Running K8s services by declaration ======
===== Goals =====
  -I'm able to declare an action in K8s with a YAML-file.
  -I'm to export the YAML configuration from a running K8s deployment.
  -I can suggest and implement at least one measure when an error message appears.

===== Basics =====
In [[en:modul:m321_aws:topics:08|this article,]] you will learn the advantages when defining actions in K8s by declarations.

===== Exercises =====
  -Work on ''08/02_Exercises/01/Exercise.md to 04/Exercise.md'' located in your repository.
  -If an error occurs, read the message carefully, think of a solution and implement it.
