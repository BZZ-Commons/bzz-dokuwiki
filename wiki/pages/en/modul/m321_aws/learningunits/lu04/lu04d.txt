===== Goals =====
  -I'm able to explain the difference between an update by recreation or rolling.
  -I'm able to perform a rolling update on a deployment with K8s.
  -I'm able to test/verify the update.
  -I'm able to query relevant information on scaled pods and services in a K8s cluster.
  -I can suggest and implement at least one measure when an error message appears.

===== Basics =====
This [[https://youtu.be/x-mo0dIeTnE|video]] demonstrates how to scale an app in Minikube running on a AWS EC2 Instance.

  -Read some [[en:modul:m321_aws:topics:07|background information]] before starting the exercise
  -Watch again the video cast.
  -Update an app in YOUR K8s cluster.
  -Memorize the procedure. It will become handy for future exercises.
