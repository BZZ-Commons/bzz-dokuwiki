====== LU02a - Basics ======

===== Introduction =====
What do you do with an assignment that reads as follows: "Explain the advantages and disadvantages of different software products in the same category." How do you go about this and what procedure do you use to determine what the advantages and disadvantages are?

===== Subjective vs. objective =====
Features of hardware and software can be compared subjectively - according to feeling - or objectively - according to measurable criteria.

  * <color #00a2e8>subjective:</color> nicer, faster, better → not measurable
  * <color #00a2e8>objective:</color> Resolution, contrast, memory size, price → measurable

===== Advantages and disadvantages =====
Advantages and disadvantages are not necessarily objective! For example: The iPhone X measures 12.4 cm 5.9 cm 0.8 cm and weighs 113g. The figures for the Galaxy S3 are 13.7 cm 7.1 cm 0.9 cm and 132g.
Is the length of 12.4 cm compared to 13.7 cm an advantage or a disadvantage? Decide for yourself and discuss with other mobile phone users. You will find supporters and opponents.
As a specialist, you should therefore speak neutrally of CRITERIA or FEATURES. A criterion is objective and each person can then contribute their own personal judgement.

===== Example =====

As an example, notebooks with Core i5 and SSD (solid state discs) are compared below (source c't 2017, issue 22). The examples (first a simple and then an extensive example) show the criteria according to which the articles are compared. The interpretation is left to the customer. The rating at the end (Fig. 02) reflects the author's subjective assessment.

The following example is much more comprehensive. A subjective assessment by the author can be found at the end of the comparison.

===== Defining criteria =====
For a system comparison, criteria must be defined that are relevant, measurable and characterise, identify and describe the objects to be compared. To do this, the framework of the comparison must first be defined.
Example of criteria for a beach holiday:

  * Hotel category (stars)
  * Half or full board
  * Room (shower/WC, sea view, balcony, air conditioning, etc.)
  * Distance to the beach
  * Condition of the beach (sand, stone ...)
  * Sunbeds, parasol (charges apply)
  * Pool, wellness / sport
  * Bar, Shopping, Nightlife, Distance to the airport

===== Decision =====
After a comparison, there is of course a decision to be made. There are many criteria that can be compared, but not all of them are equally important. In order to be able to make a decision that corresponds to our benefit, we can use a so-called utility value analysis as an aid.
