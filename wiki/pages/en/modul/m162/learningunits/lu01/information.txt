====== LU01b - Information ======

The term "information" refers to data that has meaning in a specific context. Information is facts, knowledge or findings that have value for the person who receives them. Essentially, information consists of data that can be organised, interpreted and used for a purpose.

There are different types of information, including textual, numerical, visual or auditory forms. The quality of information often depends on its accuracy, relevance, completeness and comprehensibility. Information can be used in different contexts, be it in science, business, technology or everyday life.

In the digital age, information processing and transmission plays a crucial role, and the term "information" is closely linked to concepts such as data, knowledge and communication. Information theory also deals with the quantification of information and its transmission efficiency.
